# AirLineSchoolProyect
A few months ago, I create this proyect as a final work for the OOP subject.
The proyect it's about an airline context.You can register clients, information of planes, flights, Employees,and some useless methods.
Everything you input in the program will be safe in the Aviones.txt, Empleados.txt, Vuelos.txt,and their respective .ser files.So you must implement this txt files or create another similar files.
PasajeroVIP.txt saves the passenger with greater points register (Sound's weird but it's very cool).
There is a .jpg that I never used.

You can do whathever you want with this code, there is no restrictions.
Sorry for the variable, class, and methods name in Spanish. I hope you can understand it.
